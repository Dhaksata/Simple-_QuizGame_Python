The questions list contains the questions for the quiz.
The options list contains the possible answers for each question.
The answers list contains the correct answer for each question.
The guesses list is initially empty and will be used to store the user's guesses.
The score variable is initialized to 0.
The question_num variable is initialized to 0.
The program then enters a loop that iterates over each question in the questions list.
Inside the loop, the program prints the current question and the possible answers.
The program then prompts the user to enter their guess for the current question.
The user's guess is stored in the guesses list.
The program then checks if the user's guess is correct. If it is, the score is incremented by 1 and a message is displayed indicating that the guess was correct. If the guess is incorrect, a message is displayed indicating that the guess was incorrect and the correct answer is displayed.
The question_num variable is incremented to move on to the next question.
After all questions have been asked, the program prints the results, including the user's guesses and the score.
The score is calculated by dividing the number of correct guesses by the total number of questions and multiplying by 100 to get the percentage.
